             they aren't destroyed every time I tear down the network and service ($$$) stacks.

  # An IAM role that allows the AWS CodePipeline service to perform it's
  # necessary actions. We have intentionally left permissions on this role
  # that will not be used by the CodePipeline service during this workshop.
  # This will allow you to more simply use CodePipeline in the future should
  # you want to use the service for Pipelines that interact with different
  # AWS services than the ones used in this workshop.
